                            When one thinks about aiding our communities one often mentions supporting them by offering
                            resources, others may host or throw events but what are the results of that. This may sound
                            like a platitude but it is very true in its essence, "You give a man to fish they eat for a
                            day, but if you teach a man to fish they eat for a lifetime". Our future is often a distant
                            thought. We tend to live in the past and even then its
                            difficult to live in the present. This has been the case
                            with our youth who are often forgotten. More so are the youth at risk who don't have the
                            most positive upbringing. They are often the ones who get neglected and as a result are
                            subjected to rigorious experiences. These are the youth most at need. Those that society has
                            deemed unfit to be part of it. Over my years working with kids and youth at rist, one thing
                            has been
                            certain, they need a figuere a mentor in their lives. They often lack the mentorship
                            necessary to
                            devise an appropriate plan for their future. Even more so, they don't think about the
                            future,
                            just the past, and sometimes the present. It is a vicious cycle that needs to be broken.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When I founded Reynoso's Hit N Walk, I had three core ideas in mind, help my community,
                            mentor
                            the youth, and support small busineses. I saw the need in all three areas, in fact, all
                            those
                            three areas make our communities stronger. However, one of them, the youth, stands above
                            all. They are our future, the ones who will carry on, and take the torch from us. It is our
                            duty to mentor and raise them to become the next leaders of our communities so that they
                            could pay it forward and teach the ones after them.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Youth Leadership</h2>

                        <p>
                            One of the things we can do to help shape our youth is immersing them in different
                            industries that make our economy what it is. This very distictive experience will allow them
                            to learn about the different functioning mechanisms in our society that propel it forward
                            and will expand their horizons.
                            <a href="http://#">This will utlimately</a> play into their educational experience. For
                            instance, many of our at-risk youth were taken on a tour of a Federal Prison at Terminal
                            Island. Not only did they get to tour the prison from inside, but they also were spoken to
                            by some of the inmates and offered them advise.

                            <p>
                                It takes a village to raise a child, to raise a child means more than parents helping
                                one another.

                        <p>
                            We finished that expereince with a bbq at
                            the beach. At the end, many of our mentees came out with a positive outlook and greater
                            motivation to keep on the right track. We had a debrief with many of our mentees after and
                            asked them a simple question, "how do you guys feel now after experiencing what you guys
                            did?" Many of them responded with having a positive experience but also having a much needed
                            figuere in their lives. Many of these individuals don't have the figuere or mentor in their
                            lives that keeps them on the right track. Instead, they seek for that individual an often
                            time it is in the streets.

                        <h3>Mentors</h3>

                        <p>
                            One of the things we started implementing this year has been giving each of our youth
                            leadership students a mentor. This mentor will look out for them and teach them the ropes.We
                            believe it will play a factor in helping them fullfill their potential and accomplish their
                            goals.
                        </p>

                        </p>

</code></pre> -->

                        <p>
                            We believe the benefits of this program will help shape our youth. Our mentors are people
                            who work in different industries and have a proven track record for leadership. One of
                            things we advise our mentors to do is to catch up and sit with them at least once a week.
                            Some other tasks include the following:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Go out for coffee chats.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Talk to them and see how they are doing.</li>
                                    <li>Help them with their career goals.</li>
                                    <li>Connect them to other people.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Shadow their jobs.</li>
                            <li>Volunteer with them at different events.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            At the end, it truly does take a village to raise a child. One of the last places we visit
                            is the police department. One of the reasons why is so they can get a first hand look at our
                            cities first responders and the things they experience on a daily basis. Many of our mentees
                            come out in awe at the things they learn. They get to talk to the Chief of Police. After
                            that talk he offers them an opportunity to volunteer with them or join their cadet prorgam.
                            This is one of many ways we connect our youth members to their communities. In the end, we
                            need to be there for them so that they take up the torch for the next generation.

                                    <p>Great read. I think there is a valid point in your argument although I also think
                                        the individual is largely responsible for becoming what they want to be in this
                                        world. They have to be equally motivated.</p>

                                    <p>Interesting artcile. I think it is true when you state it takes a village to
                                        raise a child. However, one point of contention is the fact that many youth
                                        especially today lack the motivation. I think there is something to be said
                                        about technology playing a role in that.</p>

                                            <p>Technology is certainly a factor, although I strongly believe the
                                                motivation comes from within. You can only do so much for someone and if

                                                    <p>Valid argument, although the motivation is often times lacking
                                                        because it is not instilled in them at an early age. The
                                                        motivation is usually the lack of motivators which often times
                                                        are their parents themselfs. I think there is something to be
                                                        said about technology also playing a large role in this. The
                                                        lack of social skills that it teachs is threatning to our
