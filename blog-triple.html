                            As we celebrate our day of Independence, we think of freedom and equality in this country.
                            However, our socitey has emphasized the word equality. What does it mean to be equal? How
                            can we achieve it? There is a lot of meaning and many possible solutions and discourse
                            people can have over this topic. Nonetheless, one thing is certain if we want to bridge the
                            gap between different
                            soci-economic classes, we need to start by teaching our kids skills that our compatible with
                            the future economy that lies in STEM.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The gap is getting wider, not the socio-economic gap, the skill gap. It is also incredibly
                            obvious and should be of much concern. To put it in perspective, technology has disrupt the
                            way we think about business. Long gone are the day where we outsource the work to another
                            country to save money on labor. Very soon, we will have automated machines doing the work
                            millions of others do overseas, for a fraction of the price. In such an environemnt, only
                            highly skilled jobs
                            will remain. It is time we equip our youth with the necessary skills to be competitve
                            individuals in the workforce. There will be many jobs that will be automated. As a result
                            there will be a large portion of our workforce being unemployed. That will only cause the
                            gap to widen even more.

                        <h2>Skills</h2>

                        <p>
                            From the earliest days of the masons to present, skills are often what an individual
                            leverages for any job. Are you good at art? Perfect, you are hired. Are you good at
                            negotiating? Perfect, welcome to our law firm. Are you good at analyzing financial
                            statements? Sweet, welcome to investment banking. What do all three of these things have in
                            common. They are all highly coveted skills. If you want to earn the big bucks you have to
                            have a skill. A skill that is high in demand. The more specialized the better. Baseball
                            players get paid big dollars for winning games. They also have a skill, hitting the ball as
                            hard as possible and out of the park. We may think that its silly and contributes absolutely
                            nothing in our society, which I might say you have a good point. Nonetheless, they have a
                            skill, and baseball teams are willing to hand them big contract as a result.
                            <a href="#">Its more than that though.</a> Some of the higher paying jobs require a
                            particular skill. Take computer coding as an example. Software egineers get paid huge
                            amounts of dollars because they are able to do something that is high in demand and is
                            conducive to the current technological environment. In fact, most high paying jobs have a
                            specialized skill that is in demand. Why then not teach individuals these skills? In fact,
                            more so teach them that they can learn it themselves without having to incur debt and spend
                            4 years at an institution that won't teach them that.
                        </p>

                            Thus, it makes sense that we should equip our children and kids with the necessary skills to
                            obtain those high paying jobs. If we do, then the incme gap will be reduced greatly. This is
                            because skills and knowledge in stem open the door for many individual looking for higher
                            paying jobs.

                            Lastly, The difference between a low paying job and a high often
                            comes down to skill. Experience plays a huge part as well, but experience is what helps
                            develop that skill.

                        <h3>STEM</h3>

                        <p>
                            So the then the question remains. Why STEM? That is the direction our society is headed.
                            STEM includes, science, technology, egineering, and math. Any of those fields have a
                            numerous amount of specialist. Take science for example. Science encompasses, doctors,
                            biologist, scientist who conduct research, etc. Same goes for the others. These are often
                            the most competitive jobs. They are also some of the highest paying ones.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I believe the best benefit could come from these field and it begins by teaching our kids
                            early on
                            about the subjects associated with STEM. Further, application of the concepts is crucially
                            important therefore the way we think about education needs to change. Recently, I was
                            saddened to hear proposals in my native state, California, where activist are trying to
                            "cancel" math citing it is not "fair and euqitable". I think one needs to examine closely
                            the effect that would have. Sure you can eliminate math, but the affluent community will
                            just
                            send their kids to private schools and they will be taught that subject. Not to mention,
                            countries like China aren't going to follow suit. They will continue to emphasize math and
                            other STEM related subjects. All they will do is place kids from lower socio-economic
                            backgrounds at a disadvantage. Now, not only have you made it less feasible to compete in a
                            competive STEM market, but you have contributed to the gap between rich and poor. It is just
                            so ironic that a state like California
                            which has benefited from STEM related industries will back paddle and disregard the very
                            thing that has made it the greatest economy in the U.S.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Instead a more reasonable solution is to teach those subjects in a way that promotes
                            entrepreneurship and higher learning. The solution to amend our education would be the
                            following:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Learning by doing
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Have students engage in the learning process by applying what they learned.</li>
                                    <li>Help them with their career goals.</li>
                                    <li>Connect them to other people.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Promote Self-Directing Learning</li>
                            <li>Encourage Independent Thinking</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            All in all, this change won't be easy. To fix anything requires one to unwravel many
                            beaucratic layers that have been placed on education. However, if we set our goals and try
                            to
                            at least accomplish them, then it could be feasible to widen the amount of indiviudals
                            entering STEM therefore
                            reducing
                            the income gap.
